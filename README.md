## History
+ **[CARSKit](https://github.com/irecsys/CARSKit)** was released in 2015, and it was the first open-source library for 
context-aware recommendations. There were no more significant updates in CARSKit since 2019. It was a library built based on Java and [Librec](https://github.com/guoguibing/librec) v1.3. 
There is a version in Python, [CARSKit-API](https://github.com/WagnoLeaoSergio/CARSKit_API), which is a python wrapper of CARSKit.
+ Recommender systems based on deep learning have been well-developed in recent years. The context-aware 
recommendation models based on traditional collaborative filtering (e.g., KNN-based CF, matrix factorization) turned out to 
be out-dated. Therefore, we develop and release [DeepCARSKit](https://github.com/irecsys/DeepCARSKit) which was built upon the [RecBole](https://recbole.io/) v1.0.0 recommendation library.
DeepCARSKit is *a Deep Learning Based Context-Aware Recommendation Library* which can be run with correct setting based on Python and [PyTorch](https://pytorch.org/).


## Feature
+ **Implemented Deep Context-Aware Recommendation Models.** Currently, we support the CARS models built based on factorization machines (FM) and 
Neural Collaborative Filtering (NeuCF and NeuMF). More algorithms will be added.

+ **Multiple Data Splits & Evaluation Options.** We provide evaluations based on both hold-out and N-fold cross validations.

+ **Extensive and Standard Evaluation Protocols.** We rewrite codes in RecBole to adapt the evaluations for context-aware recommendations.
Particularly, item recommendations can be produced for each unique combination of (user and context situation). Relevance and Ranking metrics, 
such as precision, recall, NDCG, MRR, can be calculated by taking context information into consideration.

+ **Autosave Best Logs.** DeepCARSKit can automatically save the best log/configuration of the models you run, in the folder of 'log/best/'.

+ **Other Features.** Other characteristic in DeepCARSKit are inherited from RecBole, suc as GPU accelerations.


## News & Updates
**11/13/2024**: We release DeepCARSKit v1.0.1
+ Update requirements.txt
+ Address the randomness issue in N-fold cross validation by utilizing multiprocessing

**03/19/2022**: We release DeepCARSKit v1.0.0

## Installation
DeepCARSKit works with the following operating systems:

* Linux
* Windows 10
* macOS X

DeepCARSKit requires Python version 3.7 or later, torch version 1.7.0 or later, and RecBole version 1.0.1. 
For more details, you can refer to the list of [requirements](https://github.com/irecsys/DeepCARSKit/blob/main/requirements.txt).
If you want to use DeepCARSKit with GPU,
please ensure that CUDA or cudatoolkit version is 9.2 or later.
This requires NVIDIA driver version >= 396.26 (for Linux) or >= 397.44 (for Windows10).

The DeepCARSKit library was successfully tested by using the following environments:
- `python==3.9.20`
- `recbole==1.0.1`
- `numpy==1.20.0`
- `scipy==1.6.0`
- `lightgbm==4.5.0`
- `xgboost==2.1.1`

More info about installation from conda and pip will be released later.
Currenly, you can make a git clone of the source codes. We will pulish it to pypi and conda in next release.

## Quick-Start
With the source code, you can use the provided script for initial usage of our library:

```bash
python run.py
```

This script will run the NeuCMFi model on the DePaulMovie dataset.

### Data Sets & Preparation
A list of available data sets for research on context-aware recommender systems can be found [here](https://github.com/irecsys/CARSKit/tree/master/context-aware_data_sets).
We provide two data sets (i.e., DePaulMovie and TripAdvisor) in the library. You can refer to its data format, such as [depaulmovie.inter](https://github.com/irecsys/DeepCARSKit/blob/main/dataset/depaulmovie/depaulmovie.inter).

More specifically, you need to prepare a data set looks like this: (use 'float' and 'token' to indicate numerical and nominal variables)

+ user_id:token
+ item_id:token
+ rating:float
+ context variable 1:token
+ context variable 2:token
+ context variable N:token
+ contexts:token => a concatenation of context conditions
+ uc_id:token => a concatenation of user_id and contexts

### Algorithms in NeuCMF Framework
An extensive NeuCMF framework is included in the DeepCARSKit library. There are multiple variants of the NeuCMF models in this framework.

### Hyperparameter tuning 
You can tune up the parameters from the configuration file, config.yaml

A user guide with more and more details is on the way...
